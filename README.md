## Description

Cyb3rf3nZ3 is a prototype python cybersecurity library that utilizes powerful machine learning and statistical techniques to detect malicious network traffic. With libraries such as Scikit Learn, Pandas, and NumPy, structured and preprocessed data is made available. Mathematical algorithms such as K-Means Clustering and Markov Models are then used to detect abnormalities and anomalies. 

The name Cyb3rf3nZ3 is derived from the root words "cyber" and "defense". Cyberdefense is the process of defending against a digital attack or malicious network traffic, and the name is a sole representation of the project's goal.

## Development 

This project is solely being developed by me, [CY83R-3X71NC710N](https://github.com/cy83r-3x7inc710n). Advanced Markdown techniques and thorough commenting are used to ensure that the code is maintainable and easily extensible. This project uses the [MIT license](LICENSE). This project is intended to be built off and extended to become more powerful, as the code is considered a prototype; a live version can be found [here](#). 

Some APIs used are closed source and a work in progress, and likely will not be released to public due to licensing agreements. If you choose to negotiate a potential license, [please contact](#) me. Please consider creating an open source alternative to any closed-source APIs used here.

## What Could It Become?

Cyb3rf3nZ3 is a prototype project and is only the beginning of what this project could eventually become. The goal is to create an intuitive and comprehensive cybersecurity library that utilizes powerful machine learning and statistical methods to reliably detect malicious network traffic. With this library, corporations and individuals can rest assured that their data is secure and monitored. 

The project is still in its early prototypes, but some impressive features are currently being developed. K-Means Clustering algorithms are now being used to detect anomalies, while Markov Models are being used to detect malicious traffic as well. Libraries such as Scikit Learn, Pandas, and NumPy are being used to structure and preprocess data, making the detection process much more efficient. 

This project is unique in its approach to the detection of malicious network traffic. Instead of relying solely on manual analysis and search algorithms, this project combines advanced machine learning and mathematical models with traditional detection techniques to provide an intuitive and comprehensive solution.
